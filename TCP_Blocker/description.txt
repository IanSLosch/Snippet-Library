=> if the youtube iframe element has a data-src attribute the video should not be loaded because the src attribute doesn't exist.

how it works:

when the coreFunctions is instantiated the tpcleaner will check the content of the page and check all iframe and script tag with the data-src attribute, afterward a mutationObserver will also check if there is any node update on the page and will check for iframe and script tag with a data-src on the updated node.

so even if your script adds the iframe tag with the data-src on the dom tree when the page is loaded the tpcleaner should detect it.

quick troubleshooting :

check if the coreFunction config have a tpcDomainsToBlocksection, if its the case you can remove it,

if you need to have it for a custom reason please check that the youtube domains are included.

check if the iframe injected in the node/added to the page have the data-src attribute and no src attribute
